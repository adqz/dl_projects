There are two main files. Their names and descriptions are:

1. neuralnet.py - Contains the 3 main classes (Activation, Layer, Neuralnetwork) and auxillary functions to train network and plot results.
Running this file from command line will print out results regarding the gradient checker

2. run_nn_tests.py - loads data and configuration, creates a model, and trains it on given data.

3. config.yaml - contains the hyperparameters to the network


To run the code, run the "run_nn_tests.py" file from terminal.
